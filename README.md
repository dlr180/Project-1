# Project-1
Cloud Network

This is a collection of Linux and Ansible Scripts from my Cybersecurity Bootcamp.
The scripts in this repository were used to configure the cloud servers with different docker containers.
The final setup was three servers. Two of which were running Vulnerable DVWA containers. The other two were a jump box and a server running an ELK stack container.
