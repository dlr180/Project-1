# Project-1
Cloud Network

This is a collection of Linux and Ansible Scripts from my Cybersecurity Bootcamp.
The scripts in this repository were used to configure the cloud servers with different docker containers.
The final setup was 3 servers. Two of which were running Vulnerable DVWA containers. The other two were a jump box and a server running an ELK stack container.
